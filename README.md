## About
Geoscientific workflow examples that ingest data from NCAR's Geoscience Data Exchange (GDEX) and use NCAR's HPC resource Casper for computation. This repo uses Jupyter Book 2 infrastructure to publish these example notebooks as a website.

## Example Workflows
1) Access CESM2 LENS data from GDEX [compute](notebooks/cesm_gmst_ncar.ipynb) GMST anomaly and plot.
2) Access NA-CORDEX data from NCAR's GDEX and make some diagnostic [plots](notebooks/na_cordex.ipynb)
3) Use DART reanalysis data to make [diagnostic plots](notebooks/dart-cam6.ipynb)
4) Read EOL profiler data from GDEX and [compare](notebooks/eol_era5.ipynb) with ERA5 reanalysis
5) Access JRA-3Q reanalysis data from GDEX and perform [analysis](notebooks/jra3q.ipynb)
